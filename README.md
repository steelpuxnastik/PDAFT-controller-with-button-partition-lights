# PDAFT controller with button/partition lights

Hatsune Miku Project DIVA Arcade Future Tone controller with button/partition lights support (like on official arcade) controlled by game. Only buttons (TRIANGLE, SQUARE, CROSS, CIRCLE, START) + abitily to connect 4 button LED and left/right partition RGB LED strip (without slider, for slider I recomend to use LKP https://github.com/Project-Alpaca/LKP). LED info obtained by UART, special PD-Loader plugin activation needed (coming soon).

Contains PCB and firmware for Arduino Pro Micro that used in it.

Work in progress
